# gm.dls for SFZBuilder
SFZPack of the infamous default soundbank for Microsoft GS Software Wavetable Synthesizer (also included in QuickTime Music Synthesiser for Mac users).

## Sample extraction
First, get your copy of gm.dls and extract the samples as wav files:

* C:\Windows\System32\drivers\gm.dls

As far I know, the only reliable way to extract the samples from DLS banks is by using [Extreme Sample Converter](https://www.extranslator.com/index.php?page=exsc) since it extracts the samples very clean.

After you extracted the samples, drag and drop all of them in the `samples` folder.

## Don't forget to share presets!
You can do pull requests to this repo in the `Presets` folder with your sfz files made by you! Also do the same in `Projects` if possible.
